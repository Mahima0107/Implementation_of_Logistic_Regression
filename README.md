# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical technique for binary classification. It models the probability of a binary outcome (in this case, diabetes: yes or no) as a logistic (sigmoid) function of a weighted sum of predictors (age, BMI, glucose levels, etc.) 
The model outputs a probability between 0 and 1. , 
A common threshold is 0.5: above → predicts diabetes (1); below → no diabetes (0)
