# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical technique for binary classification. It models the probability of a binary outcome (in this case, diabetes: yes or no) as a logistic (sigmoid) function of a weighted sum of predictors (age, BMI, glucose levels, etc.) 
The model outputs a probability between 0 and 1. , 
A common threshold is 0.5: above → predicts diabetes (1); below → no diabetes (0)

* In this dataset There are 9 columns and 768 rows.
* Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
* Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

🔍 Feature Insight 
* In logistic regression models on the Diabetes dataset, glucose levels are the most powerful predictor of diabetes risk, closely followed by BMI, number of pregnancies, age, and genetic predisposition, while insulin, blood pressure, and skinfold thickness show minimal predictive power.”
